    "In this notebook, we will analyze data from **4 athletes** doing a repetitive exercise (e.g., push-ups) in **2 sessions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each **athlete** has:\n",
    "    * **Session 1** (fewer repeats)\n",
    "    * **Session 2** (more repeats)\n",
    "* In each session, the athlete performs many **repeats**, and every repeat has a **correctness score** between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Do athletes show lower correctness scores in the session with a higher number of repeats?**\n",

    "## Why a Simple t-test Is Not Enough\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this might look like a simple comparison of Session 1 vs. Session 2 correctness scores. However, there is an important complication:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The data are clustered within athletes.**\n",
    "    * Repeats from the **same athlete** are likely more similar to each other than to repeats from another athlete.\n",
    "    * This violates the **independence assumption** of simple tests like the standard t-test or simple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ignore the fact that multiple measurements come from the same person, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Over-count evidence (treat each repeat as if it were a completely independent person).\n",
    "* Underestimate variability.\n",
    "* Risk **inflated Type I error** (finding “significant” effects that are not actually reliable).\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this structure properly, we need a model that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lets us estimate the **overall effect of session type** (low vs. high volume), **and**\n",
    "* Accounts for the fact that **each athlete has their own baseline performance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what a **Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM)** is designed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a Linear Mixed-Effects Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Linear Mixed-Effects Model** is like a regular linear regression model, but with two types of effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fixed effects** (Population-level)\n",
    "    * These are the effects we are primarily interested in.\n",
    "    * They describe how the *average* correctness changes with predictors like **session type** (low vs. high volume).\n",
    "    * Example: “On average, correctness is 0.08 lower in the high-volume session.”\n",
    "2.  **Random effects** (Individual-level)\n",
    "    * These capture **individual-specific deviations** from the overall average.\n",
    "    * In our case, each athlete may have a different baseline correctness level.\n",
    "    * Example: Athlete A is generally more accurate than Athlete B, regardless of session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random effects allow the model to say:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “All athletes share some common pattern (fixed effect), but each athlete is allowed to start at their own baseline level (random effect).”\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination lets us **borrow strength across athletes** while still respecting that they are different. \n",

    "* $i$ index **athletes** (1 to 4)\n",
    "* $j$ index **sessions** (1 or 2)\n",
    "* $k$ index **repeats** within a session\n",
